# Myo Hand Gestures w/ morphSVG
Interactive example using the Myo.

If you do not have a Myo and only wish to see the morphSVG, comment out myo.connect(); and use the keys z, x, c, v to morph.

IMPORTANT: You will need to provide your own Greensock libraries to work with the morphSVG. Place your TweenMax.min.js, MorphSVGPlugin.min.js and CustomEase.min.js into the js folder.
